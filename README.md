Php-order-form is a project made by Hsia. It's a challenge asigned by BECODE LIEGE code training center. I have been working on this from 18/03/2021 to 23/03/2021 to learn about the basic knowledge of PHP, how to create PHP images, how to manage docker and how to use heroku...etc.

# Mission
You are hungry, very hungry :drooling_face:. You would like to order some food to fill your empty belly but your favorite pizza√Ølo takes many times to answer the phone and he doesn't have a order form on his website.

With your new PHP powers you offer him to implement a form to record the deliveries and no longer take orders by phone. Of course, he will pay you... with pizzas :pizza: .
